# Lumi Language Guide

Welcome to **Lumi** programming language guide!

Lumi is a general purpose programming language that is good for all needs,
specially for long-term project, or where resources efficiency is needed.

Lumi aims to be safe, efficient, flexible, easy to write,
and easy to maintain. See [Lumi Goals and Features](goals.md) and
[Lumi Syntax](syntax.md) for more details.

Lumi files use ``.lm`` extension.

"Lumi" name was chosen because:

* "Lumi" is an abbreviation for "Illuminating", which is clearly a good thing.
  (and the meaning of my name "Meir" in Hebrew)
* "Lumi" means "snow" in Finnish, which is bright, light, handy, flexible,
  strong and fun. (and I like snow)
* "Lumi" is short and fun to say.
