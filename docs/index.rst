Lumi Language Guide
===================

Welcome to **Lumi** programming language guide!

Lumi is a general purpose programming language that is good for all needs,
specially for long-term projects, or where resource efficiency is needed.

Lumi aims to be safe, efficient, flexible, easy to write,
and easy to maintain. See :ref:`goals` for more details.

Lumi files use ``.lm`` extension.

"Lumi" name was chosen because:

* "Lumi" is an abbreviation for "Illuminating", and Lumi language aims to cast
  new light to the programming world. (it's also the meaning of my first name)
* "Lumi" means "snow" in Finnish, which is bright, light, handy, flexible,
  strong and fun - such as the Lumi language. (and also - I like snow)
* "Lumi" is short, easy to pronounce, and fun to say.
